## Testing 

During my project I encountered certain challenges that I had to overcome, such as the page layout using flexbox and with my nav button, the website is fully responsive on tablets, laptops and large screens.
At the beginning of the project I should have made more commits at each stage of my project, but I wasn't, after advice from my Tutor I started to make my commits frequently as I progressed during my project.
