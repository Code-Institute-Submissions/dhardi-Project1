            <h2>Side Control</h2>
            <p>
              Side control is a pinning position in Brazilian jiu-jitsu when
              you're perpendicular to your opponent and are not entangled in
              their legs. Typically but not always you're chest to chest with
              your opponent. It is one of the 6 main positions in BJJ and it's
              where you end up most often after passing the guard.

            <h2>High Guard / Full Guard</h2>
            <img
              src="./assets/images/hightguard.jpg"
              alt="high guard position"
            />
            <p>
              Sometimes referred to as full guard, the closed guard is the
              typical guard position. In this guard the legs are hooked behind
              the back of the opponent, preventing them from standing up or
              moving away. The opponent needs to open the legs up to be able to
              improve positioning.

          <div id="back-control">
            <h2>Back Control</h2>
            <img
              src="./assets/images/backcontrol.PNG"
              alt="back control jiu jitsu"
            />
            <p>
              There are two positions in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu that score four
              points in most competition rulesets: One of them is the full
              mount, and the other is back mount, often referred to as back
              control. In terms of BJJ back control, getting behind someone
              during grappling exchanges is far easier than staying there for a
              prolonged period of time. That said, by gaining a basic
              understanding of WHAT your goals are from back control and HOW to
              attain them, you’ll become nearly impossible to shake off – making
              you essentially a human backpack!

          <div id="full-mount">
            <h2>Full Mount</h2>
            <img
              src="./assets/images/fullmount.PNG"
              alt="full guard jiu jitsu"
            />
            <p>
              For those that have no idea what the mount is, it is a position
              where one person the defender is lying supine on the ground, and
              the other person the attacker has their legs straddled around
              their waist from the top. Both the knees and the feet of the
              attacker are on the ground, making movement pretty difficult for
              the defender.

          <div id="half-guard">
            <h2>Half-Guard</h2>
            <img
              src="./assets/images/halfguard.PNG"
              alt="half guard jiu jitsu"
            />
            <p>
              The half guard, also known by its Portuguese name: meia-guarda, is
              a grappling position of unknown origin, greatly developed in the
              early 1990s by Roberto Correa, a well-known Jiu-Jitsu athlete at
              the time. The definition of grappling guard requires that the
              bottom player grappler with his back towards the mat makes use of
              his legs to control the distance between himself and the guard
              passer grappler on top, the half guard follows that same concept,
              only in this case the half guard player will have both his legs
              controlling only one of his opponent’s legs.
