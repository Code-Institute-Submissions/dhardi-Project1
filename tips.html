        <h2>Things You’ll Need Before Your First Brazillian Jiu Jistu Class</h2>
        <p>
          You’re not alone. We all had the same emotions while heading to our
          first BJJ class. Fortunately, BJJ dojos are some of the most accepting
          places on the planet. The other students at the gym have once been in
          your shoes, so you don’t have to worry about anyone giving you a hard
          time. Most of your training partners and instructors will go out of
          their way to make you feel as comfortable as possible during classes.
          Preparing for classes can make your transition into a BJJ player much
          smoother. Some of the essential things you should pick up before
          heading into your first BJJ class include:
        </p>
        <div id="tips-content">
          <div id="nails">
            <h2>Short trimmed</h2>
            <p>
              A basic rule of thumb to follow in jiu-jitsu is that you shouldn’t
              be able to see your fingernails at all if you’re looking at your
              palm, but even that can be a bit too long, depending on your nail
              and finger shape. Try to keep both your finger and toenails
              trimmed as low as you can without feeling pain or discomfort.
              Obviously, cutting your nails too short can put you at risk for
              bleeding and infection, so use your best judgment and maintain a
              length that will keep your digits happy without making you a
              scratch risk.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div id="mouth-guard">
            <h2>Mouth Guard</h2>
            <p>
              Don’t worry, no one will roundhouse your face during BJJ class,
              but you still need a mouth guard. BJJ is a high-contact sport, so
              collisions do occur occasionally. A mouth guard keeps your teeth
              intact when such rare collisions occur. It’s the main protective
              gear you need when training. There’s no need to get one of the
              expensive mouthguards used by boxers. The cheap mouth guards sold
              at supermarkets are good enough for BJJ.

          <div id="clean-kimono">
            <h2>Clean Your Kimono</h2>
            <p>
              Maintaining your gi begins as soon as you are done rolling. It’s
              critical that you wash your gi after your class as soon as
              possible. The longer bacteria, sweat, and blood stay on the
              fabric, the more they eat away at the material, thus reducing its
              longevity. Of course, washing a stain as quickly it happens will
              help prevent it from becoming a permanent patch. Also, not
              cleaning your gi right away will cause it to stink and smell. You
              should always wash your gi after every practice, even if you did
              “light” rolling or did not break a sweat. When you get home, you
              should take your gi and belt out of your bag and put it in the
              washer.
